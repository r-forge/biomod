2.1.13 (2013-03-06)
	* Add ProbDensFunc() function to package to produce nice plots that show inter-models variability

2.1.12 (2013-03-04)
	* add rasterVis dependency for nicer biomod2 plots
	* PA.dist.min and PA.dist.max are now defined in meters  when you work with unprojected rasters in disk pseudo absences selection

2.1.9 (2013-02-28)
	* possibility to indicate manualy which data should be used for calibration (resp. for validation) of models within BIOMOD_Modeling

2.1.9 (2013-02-27)
	* one var modeling supported (thanks Anne O.)
	* new options for response curves ploting (col, lty, data_species...)

2.1.8 (2013-02-25)
  * response plot supports now formal models

2.1.0 (2013-02-21)
  * MAJOR RELEASE
	* CRAN SUBMISION
	* add of a modelling.id arg (BIOMOD_Modeling) for prevent from no wanted models overwriting and facilitate models tests and comparisions (thanks Frank B.)
	* change of biomod2 dataset
	* vignettes and help files update (thanks Sam P. & Signe N.)
	* save link between modeling and projection objects
	* add pROC package dependencie
	* add a modeling cleaner that remove modeling objects from both memory and hard drive: RemoveProperly()


2.0.11 (2013-02-18)
	* possibility to consider a user.defined pseudo absences selection (thanks to Signe N.)
	* possibility to swith off stepwise glm selection (thanks Frank B.)

2.0.9 (2013-02-15)
	* automatic save on hard drive of BIOMOD_Projection outputs

2.0.8 (2013-02-14)
	* BIOMOD_LoadModels supports multiple models input
	* deal with NA in evaluation table issue (thanks Frank B.)

2.0.7 (2013-02-12)
	* bug on weights corrected (thanks to Lugi M.)

2.0.3 (2013-01-18)
	* deal with MAXENT categorical variables and categorical raster input

2.0.0 (2013-01-17)
  * MAJOR RELEASE
	* CRAN SUBMISION
	* models built within biomod2 are now defined as "biomod2 models objects" (own scaling models, own predict function,...)
	* full paths are replaced by relative paths to favorise portability
	* harmonization of names of objects that are saved on hard drive (more coherence between functions)
  * possibility to save projections directly in raster format (.grd or .img)

1.x.x
	* development phase
